			During slavery, the slave masters would try to separate Africans who came from the same tribe or spoke the same tongue by sending them 
            off to another plantation. This was a plot to help break the bonds between the slaves and weaken them mentally. Taken 
            from the homelands and separated from their people with no knowledge of how to communicate with the others. It was also 
            a requirement of them to speak English. In means of finding a way to communicate with each other and the slave masters, a 
            pidgin was created and eventually evolved into a creole. Each Caribbean country has its own unique creole such as Jamaican 
            creole also known as Patois (Pat-wah). There are still arguments on whether Patois is a real language or a dialect but 
            there is no mistake that it is widely used across the country.
