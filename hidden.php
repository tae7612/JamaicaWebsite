                The Blue Hole and the Secret Falls – This is a personal favourite of mine. The Blue Hole and secret falls 
                are the hidden gems of Ocho Rios. It is not commercialised like the other falls on the island. The trip to 
                get there is a bit bumpy but once you lay eyes on the water be prepared to have your breath taken away. Swing 
                Tarzan style and dive into the water, visit the small cave, climb the waterfalls and relax in this beautiful 
                paradise.

                Blue Hole Mineral Spring – Another hidden gem of Jamaica found in Westmorland. Very few know of the second Blue Hole 
                in Jamaica, the mineral spring. Find courage and jump thirty feet into a deep mineral bath and relax in the water or 
                climb out and jump again!

                Dunns River Falls – This isn’t so much as a hidden spot but it’s a must see. If there is one thing every tourist of 
                Jamaica should do, it is to climb the Dunn’s River Falls, one of Jamaica’s oldest but still popular attractions. It’s 
                an unforgettable and fun experience to when you finally reach the top.

                dive into some clearest blue water that Jamaica has to offer. Set right in, Negril Rick’s Café offers adventure, a 
                place to make good memories and a front row seat I watching the sunset right on that ocean horizon.
