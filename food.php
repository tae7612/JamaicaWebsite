            Food is everything to culture and more importantly to the Jamaican culture. From the slavery days to the emancipation 
            Jamaica was left with a set of culturally mixed people. Customs were shared and some even born from the mix of the process 
            of creating a new set of people and food was not excluded from this. Many Jamaican recipes could be said to have the 
            influence of the Maroons, Spanish, Chinese and Africans. Of course, there are way too many Jamaican dishes to list but I’ll 
            give you a few:

            <li>
                Jerk – Whether it’s chicken, pork, shrimp, crab or ackee if you can eat it we can jerk it. Jerk is the first thing 
                that comes to mind when thinking about Jamaican food. Using spices such as Scotch bonnet pepper, pimento, nutmeg and 
                thyme to get one of the greatest tasting dishes in Jamaica.

        <ul>

                Patty – More formally known as the Jamaican Patty is a treat filled with seasoned meat or occasionally vegetables or 
                soy meat. A patty to a Jamaican is a hamburger to an American, not just any patty will do.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Escovitch fish – is fried fish marinated with vinegar, onions and other spices with a spicy catch. A style of cooking 
                originating from the Spanish Jews that lived on the island centuries ago.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bun and Cheese – Bun is a spiced bread usually filled with raisin and fruits. It is often eaten with cheese especially 
                around Easter.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Curried Goat – Nothing more Jamaican than a ram goat cooked in our own flavour of Jamaican curry.
            </li>
        </ul>
