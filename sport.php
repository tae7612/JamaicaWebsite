            Jamaica has not only made a name for itself through its music, history and landscape but has also dominated in the
            world of sports. An amazing feat for a small island such as itself. Jamaican athletes have moved onto competing head
            on against bigger nations. Amazing crowds with their wins and even shattering records setting higher goals for the sports
            world.

            The sport we are most well-known for would, of course, be, Track and Field. Jamaica is known to groom some of the fastest
            athletes in the world like Merlene Ottey, Shelly-Ann Fraser, Asafa Powell and the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt.
