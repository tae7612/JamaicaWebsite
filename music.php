		<p>
			Music is a giant foundation in Jamaica. Originating from our enslaved ancestors who sang for another form of communication
            and evolving into the steady riddims of reggae and exciting beats of dancehall. Music continues to grow and inspires others in
            the country.

			to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music 
			style that evolved out of the earlier genres like Ska and Rocksteady.
