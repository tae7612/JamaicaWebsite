             The first inhabitants of Jamaica were the Tainos who ventured from South America to settle in the Greater Antilles. 
             Jamaica was rediscovered in 1494 by Christopher Columbus during his search of a direct route from Europe to Asia. 
             The Spanish not so long after began to inhabit the island using it as a base for food production. 
             They began to enslave the Tainos driving them to hard labour. Most of Tainos either escaped or died from overwork, 
             diseases from the Europeans or suicide leading to their eventual genocide in the seventeenth country.

            In 1655, the British arrived with the mind to take the island of Jamaica from the Spanish. They won the war and took control of the land. 
            By this time, they had already started enslaving the Africans and forcing them to work on the sugarcane plantations.
            After many years of slavery, the slaves began to rebel where people such as Samuel Sharpe stirred up the groups and convinced them to fight for 
            their freedom. Slavery was abolished in 1807and Jamaica was given its emancipation in 1838. On August 6, 1962, Jamaica became fully independent from the British.

            Following its independence, Jamaica's economy began to grow but in the 1980s, it was hit by a severe recession.

            Today, Jamaica's economy is still based largely on tourism and the related service sector and it has recently held various free democratic elections.
