            Jamaica can be found in the Caribbean among the other Greater Antilles. Cuba, Haiti, Dominica Republic and Puerto Rico.  
            The island is in the Northern and Western hemispheres with a latitude of 17 degrees North and a longitude of 77 and 79 degrees West. 
            It is the third largest island in the Caribbean covering a total area of 10,991 square meters.

            Jamaica has a very varied topography. The island is covered mountains, valleys and plateaus and coastal plains. Still, Jamaica is regarded as a very mountainous island since nearly half the island’s surface is more than 1000 feet above sea level. The east of Jamaica would be considered 
            the most rugged part where you will find the Blue Mountains. These mountains have a high peak of 7,402 feet making them the tallest mountains in the country. 
            Other significant mountains would be Dry Harbor and John Crow.  While mountains seem to define Jamaica, the country still has limestone plateaus making up two-thirds of the land. 
            These plateaus create landscapes with sinkholes, ridges and caverns and have limestone caves scattered across the island. The coastal plains surround the island and are 
            found to be most dominant in the south.

            Over a hundred rivers can be found in Jamaica most running underground through the limestone rivers or too small to explore. The wider river on the island would be Black river and the 
            longest is Rio Minho.

        <p>
            Jamaica has a tropical climate influenced by the sea and north-east winds blowing throughout the day and night. Temperatures are warm all year round and don’t 
            usually go higher than 32 °C. Although colder winds come down during the winter season the temperature does not usually drop below 15 °C. The lowest recorded temperature 
            in Jamaica would be at the mountain peaks at 4 °C.
